# Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industry-using-Logistic-Regression

### Problem Statement: 
Define what constitutes churn for your telecom business. Churn can include both voluntary churn (customers choosing to switch to a different provider) and involuntary churn (customers leaving due to factors like payment issues or relocation).

### Business Impact
Understand the financial implications of churn. Calculate the direct revenue loss from lost customers and the potential long-term impact on brand reputation and market share.

### Intervention Strategies
Based on the insights gained from analysis, design strategies to reduce churn. This might involve improving customer service, offering personalized retention offers, enhancing network coverage, or introducing loyalty programs.

### Data
Data is available is three csv files and a data dictionary is provided to define/explain all the variables.

[Data used](/kaggle/input/logistic-regression-use-case-churn)
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. 

The main types of attributes are:

1. Demographics (age, gender etc.)
2. Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
3. Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)
 

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not.<br> 
So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.
With 21 predictor variables we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not.
